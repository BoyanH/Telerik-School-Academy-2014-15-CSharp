1.I am using SQL Express, you may need to change the connection string to the database.

2. Admin roles exist; Check the DB Seeding

ADMIN: UserName: "BoyanH" Pass: "Notrealpass1."

3. As always with ASP.NET MVC and Telerik Homeworks, you will need to install the packages for yourself ;) (Should happen automaticaly)

16MB are not enough to include all the packages, required for the DB servers, therefore I deleted packages folder from all but the first project, so copy it from there in every folder to run each task.

ALSO: Most of the task require to have installed sqlexpress and connect via .\SQLEXPRESS, the last task uses it's own DB, which's backup file is provided. Install it before running ;)
